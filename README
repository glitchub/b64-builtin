b64-builtin - base64 encode/decode for bash

Useful in cases where you need to handle a lot of base64-encoded data and find that repeatedly
spawning the base64 utility is taking too much time.

Make sure you have bash builtin support installed, i.e. via debian "apt install bash-builtins".

Run "make" to create file "b64-builtin".

To use, run the following bash command:

    enable -f /path/to/b64-builtin b64

"help b64" will then show the usage:

    b64: b64 [-de] [file]
        Base64 encode/decode the given file, or standard input, to standard output.

        Options:
          -d       decode base64 text to binary
          -e       encode binary to base64 text (default)

        Encoded base64 is output as a single line without terminating CR. Unexpected characters
        encountered during decode are ignored.

        Exit Status:
        Returns success unless an invalid option or filename is given.

To test:

    $ md5sum /usr/share/dict/words
    16de2454dee65e9ceed77f9c1cd8a15e /usr/share/dict/words

    b64 /usr/share/dict/words | b64 -d | md5sum
    16de2454dee65e9ceed77f9c1cd8a15e -

    b64 /usr/share/dict/words | base64 -d | md5sum
    16de2454dee65e9ceed77f9c1cd8a15e -

    base64 /usr/share/dict/words | b64 -d | md5sum
    16de2454dee65e9ceed77f9c1cd8a15e -
